## 🤷‍♀️ Question Time

### 👨‍🔬 What is this?

CryptoBet allows you to deploy a smart contract where you get to choose the timing and the pricing of the bet and everything and later on users can play a game where they will be able to bet on the price of Eth in the time interval chosen by the owner of the contract and based off the correct or wrong guess the player will be rewarded with crypto or lose the crypto they locked in to the contract while entering the game.

### 🕵️ What is Crypto?

Cryptocurrency is an ERC-20 token standard currency, they are standards that have been approved by the community and are used to convey technical requirements and specifications for certain use cases.

ERC-20 specifically is a standard which outlines the technical specification of a fungible token.

### 🤔 How is blockchain the solution to this?

Most of the betting games rely on a centralized entity to lock their money into a game and that is not trustless at all, also a lot of the betting games require credit cards and all kinds of different payment methods and that's definitely not accessible to everyone, whereas with blockchain you are trusting an open-source smart contract to lock your funds in and a simple wallet is required to play this game.

## ☄️ What's next?

This is just the beginning of this amazing game I have built so far and in the future the smart contract will have more customizable features such as playing with multiple players and mainly deploy this game to mainnet. There will also be other ways to win with cryptoBet, due to lack of time and not knowing about this amazing hackathon earlier on i couldn't add a lot of the things i personally had planned for this game.
